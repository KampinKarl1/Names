# Names
A class that gives names initialized into an array for C# so you don't have to write a bunch of names and last names.

Do you want to add people to a project and give them random names? Do you want to skip writing a bunch of names and surnames?

This class is designed to give you two arrays: one of first names, and one of last names and allow you to randomly get a first, last, or full name.
